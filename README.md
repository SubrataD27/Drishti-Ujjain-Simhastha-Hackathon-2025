## 1. Executive Summary

Mass religious gatherings (e.g. Simhastha Kumbh 2028, Ujjain) require real‑time situational awareness, predictive crowd risk modelling, coordinated logistics, and rapid multi‑channel response. Project DRISHTI is a unified Command & Intelligence Dashboard that fuses simulated (extensible to live) telemetry (crowd density, drones, SOS, choke points, logistics, service health, communications) into an adaptive, themeable, performance‑tuned interface. It is engineered for clarity under stress, with predictive assist ("Samanjasya / Vishwas / Suraksha" AI advisory model concept) and modular expansion readiness.

## 2. Core Value Propositions

1. Situational Fusion: One pane for crowd, risk, resource, and operational layers.
2. Predictive Prevention: Choke point risk scores + 15/30 min density projections.
3. AI Assist Hooks: Extensible modal workflow for AI‑generated interventions & approvals.
4. Operational Efficiency: Drone fleet overview, logistics depletion ETAs, service uptime.
5. Communication Integrity: Central announcements & rumor-control readiness.
6. Rapid Theming & Presentation: Accent palette + glass morphism for stakeholder demos.
7. Offline‑Ready Design (planned): Architecture prepared for progressive enhancement & caching.

## 3. Feature Matrix (Implemented)

| Domain | Key Features |
|--------|--------------|
| Live Map | Dual engine (Leaflet fallback + optional Mapbox), animated pilgrims, heat layer, choke point markers, sector polygons |
| KPI Ribbon | Continuous marquee: Threat Level, Crush Risk Index, Supply Sufficiency %, Drone Coverage %, Rising Sectors, Median Response SLA |
| Predictive Crowd | Sector density now / +15 / +30 with trend classification |
| Choke Points | Risk score + time‑to‑issue ETA |
| Drone Fleet | Status, task, battery, sector assignment, ETAs |
| Logistics | Stock levels, depletion time forecasts, low‑stock flagging |
| SOS / Alerts | Simulated incoming alerts + AI advisory modal (approve / reject workflow) |
| System Health | Latency, error rates, service status heat semantics |
| Communications | Multi-channel announcement logs & approvals |
| Theming | 6 accent palettes, glass mode toggle, persistent localStorage |
| Responsiveness | Mobile bottom sheet panel, condensed metric strip, adaptive layout |
| Performance | Code-splitting (lazy views), dynamic map engine loader, selective re-rendering |

## 4. Technology Stack

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| Frontend Framework | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite |
| Styling | TailwindCSS, custom accent system, glass mode utility classes |
| Motion | Framer Motion (entrances, panel transitions, KPI marquee) |
| Mapping | Leaflet + leaflet.heat (default), optional Mapbox-GL (dynamic import) |
| Charts | Recharts (lightweight compositional charts) |
| Data Simulation | Faker.js seeded dynamic generators (extensible to APIs) |
| State | Context API (App & Theme contexts) |
| Build / Deploy | Vite build, Netlify deploy config (SPA redirect + asset caching) |

## 5. Architecture Overview

```text
src/
    components/      Core UI modules (map wrappers, panels, ribbon, modals)
    components/views Domain views (Analytics, Logistics, Drones, etc.)
    contexts/        AppContext (UI state), ThemeContext (accent/glass)
    utils/           mockData generator (telemetry + predictive synthesis)
    hooks/           Responsive/media preference utilities
```

Separation ensures: (1) modifiability per domain, (2) lazy loading for heavy views, (3) theming decoupled from business logic, (4) future substitution of mock generators with real API clients.

## 6. Data Simulation Model

The generator (`mockData.ts`) synthesizes:

- Crowd density per sector with peak-hour shaped baselines
- Short-horizon predictive density (now / +15 / +30) with trend classification
- SOS alerts & spatial scatter via radial randomization
- Drone operational states + battery + ETA logic
